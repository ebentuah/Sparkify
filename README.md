# Sparkify
Using Apache Spark for Data Engineering and Machine Learning

## Libraries Used:
PySpark SQL Libraries for Data Engineering. 
PySpark ML libraries for feature enginneering, modelling, tuning and evaluation. 
SeaBorn and Matplotlib for visualizationn

## Project Motivation:
Sparkify is a hypothetical music streaming company just like Spotify or Pandora.
Users can either use the free model or the paid model. They can upgrade or cancel at anytime.
Every action of a user including hearing a song, artist, pages they visit within Sparkify, events they do including listening to ad, disliking/liking a song is recorded.
The aim of this analysis would be to create a model using these signals which can predict the users who are about to churn. This can help the business retain these customers by providing discounts or incentives potentially saving millions of dollars in revenue.
